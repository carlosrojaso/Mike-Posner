				<h2 class="text-left">These are the books that have impacted my life this most:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle - I avoided this book for years because of its popularity. Anything powerful canâ€™t be popular
						right? WRONG. I realized it was so popular for a reason: itâ€™s a life changer. I read it five times this year and listened to it
						on audio an additional two times!
					</li>
					<li>
						The Alchemist by paulo coelho - @bigsean recommended this book to me. Itâ€™s heart opening and appropriate for ages 12 and up!
					</li>
					<li>Siddharta by Herman Hesse</li>
					<li>The Catcher in the Rye - J.D. Salinger</li>
					<li>Demian by Herman Hesse</li>
					<li>
						Ask and It Is Given by Esther Hicks is the book @bigsean recommended to me and it changed my life by adding a spiritual
						component to my existence. He used to travel with it everywhere (he might stillðŸ˜Š). I came back to it this year.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Stranger by Camus was literally mind blowing in a totally different way. This novel was recommended by @bookerbbbrown. At
						the end I felt so liberated by the fact that this is all finite! Like...wow.
					</li>
					<li>
						Labyrinths by Jorge Luis Borges was recommended by @danwilsonmusic and it actually wasnâ€™t very fun to read but weeks later I
						realized my imagination had literally been taken to places it never had been before. The stories feel like my own memories now.
						Borges saw the world in a way no one else did or does.
