				<ol>
					<li></li>
					<li>2009 - A Matter of Time - This was the mixtape I made in my dorm room that sort of started my professional career.</li>
					<li>2009 - One Foot Out the Door - This was my second mixtape.</li>
					<li>2010 - 31 Minutes to Takeoff - This was my first studio album.</li>
					<li>2011 - The Layover - This was my really cool mixtape from 2011.</li>
					<li>2012 - Sky High - (never released)</li>
					<li>2014 - Pages (never released)</li>
					<li>
						2016 - At Night, Alone. This was the album where I got really good at songwriting. One of the songs “I Took A Pill in Ibiza” got
						really popular and nominated for a Grammy.
					</li>
					<li>
						2017 - Mansionz. This was the album I made with Blackbear. Mansionz is our band that we have together. We dyed our hair green.
					</li>
					<li>2017 - Tear Drops and Balloons - this is the audiobook of my book of poetry, “Tear Drops and Balloons"</li>
					<li>
						2018 - “i was born in detroit on a very, very, very, very, very, very, very cold day” This is a LIVE album that I made as I
						toured with my band, The Legendary Mike Posner Band. Each night I did a new poem at the concerts. The band had never heard the
						poems until we were on the stage. They made up the music each night to follow what I was saying. That’s what made them
						legendary.
					</li>
					<li>2018 - A Real Good Kid. This is the best album ever. Seriously, I really love this album.</li>
