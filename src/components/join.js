				<ul class="body text-left">
					<li>You are responsible for being able to physically walk. This is no easy ride.</li>
					<li>
						You will NOT bring or use drugs or alcohol of any sort. This includes marijuana. We will be guests in towns across the country
						and I have no interest in babysitting inebriated people.
					</li>
					<li>You will find your own place to sleep if joining for multiple nights</li>
					<li>You will dress appropriately.</li>
